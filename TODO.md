# ToDo

Oh god the hipsters are consuming my mind.

* Node.js - because Javascript is still better than Ruby
* Coffeescript - because Javascript sucks
* Express - I want rails but I hate rails
* Jade - HTML templating, looks nothing like HTML
* LESS - Intelligent CSS, actually good language, broke-y npm module
* MongoDB - Key-value datastore, SQL is so last millenium
* Mongoose - because apparently MongoDB needs its hand held
* Redis - one datastore is not enough.  Also pub-sub
* jQuery - because Javascript sucks, client side now
* Backbone - MVC client side.
* Underscore - JS helpers, and used by Backbone
* jQuery-UI - we want this thing to fucking sparkle
* jQuery-Mobile - you should read everything on your cell phone and/or watch

Actual TODO list
 * actually use the "ie ie6" and whatever shims, right now just not supporting
